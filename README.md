# ulnaSimpleRouter
A simple isomorphic app demonstrating Ulna's routing capabilities

Until Ulna's documentation is fleshed out, this example implementation should serve as a loose guide and demonstration for now.

The server runs on Hapi. To run it, download the repo, install the dependencies, and then

    node server
  
Hapi should start at localhost:8080. If all goes well, you should see names, which will reveal quotes from the associated characters when clicked. Try clicking on a few, navigating back and forward to change the state, and refreshing.

Beware, the Ulna source code is still a moving target. While this example works, the original source code has already diverged. An updated implementation will be provided in the future.
